Small business vendors are included in OASIS SB and other-than-small vendors are included in OASIS itself.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier for contracting officers to find information about those vendors and the services that they provide, 18F worked with OASIS to create a [discovery tool](https://discovery.gsa.gov/). The source of the tool—built using the Django framework—is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/18F/discovery/). \r\n\r\n### What we are asking\r\n\r\nThe data for the tool is loaded through [a series of Django management commands](https://github.com/18F/discovery#getting-the-data). This micro-purchase aims to streamline that process. First, we’d like to update [the CSVs of vendors currently in the repository](https://github.com/18F/discovery/tree/master/vendor/docs), based on the [current data](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/206191) on the [OASIS site](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/206191). Then, we’d like to create a single command to run the various steps used to create the data. Finally, we’d like to create a fixture of the resulting data, so that it can be quickly loaded into the tool.\r\n\r\n### Specific acceptance criteria\r\n\r\n#### Update the vendor pool CSVs\r\n\r\n- When a user visits the GitHub repository\r\n- Then they find the same vendors in the CSVs as on the GSA website\r\n\r\n#### Create a single command to produce a fixture of the latest data\r\n\r\n- Given a fresh environment\r\n- When an admin runs the command\r\n- Then the latest data is created following the manual steps in [README.md](https://github.com/18F/discovery/blob/master/README.md)\r\n- And a Django fixture is created with that data\r\n\r\n### General acceptance criteria\r\n\r\n- All new functionality will be covered by new unit tests.\r\n- There will be no decrease in test coverage.\r\n- Tests run on Circle CI and do not break the build.\r\n- New features do not degrade accessibility (measured with pa11y/HTML Code Sniffer).\r\n- **A payment URL is specified in your profile so that we can pay the award**\r\n\r\n\r\n","ended_at":"2016-09-16T17:00:00+00:00","github_repo":"https://github.com/18F/discovery","id":30,"issue_url":"https://github.com/18F/discovery/issues/419","skills":["CSV","Python"],"start_price":3500,"started_at":"2016-09-14T17:00:00+00:00","summary":"We'd like to streamline the process of updating the data on the [discovery tool](https://discovery.gsa.gov/) to make it easier for contracting officers to find current information about those vendors and the services that they provide.

This issue seeks to create a user role of \"Agency Admin\" that gives the user access to all of the admin pages in that agency. For this micro-purchase to be complete, the vendor will create an `isAgencyAdmin` property on the user, create a policy to regulate agency admin access, and create the ability for admins to promote users to an agency admin.\r\n\r\nThis will be used for future functionality on the agency data tag.\r\n\r\nFor more information please see the [Github Issue](https://github.com/18F/openopps-platform/issues/1229)\r\n\r\n## Auction rules\r\n\r\nRegistered users on micropurchase.18f.gov may bid to deliver the requirements in this auction. The lowest bidder at the time the auction closes shall receive the award. The awarded bidder shall have five business days to deliver the requirements. Upon successful completion of the requirements, 18F shall pay the winning bidder.\r\n\r\nAlso see our [policies and guidelines page](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/faq).\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n### 1.) Add “agency admin” property to user\r\n\r\nA migration script to add `isAgencyAdmin` to the midas_user table\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2.) Develop an “agency admin” policy\r\n\r\nGiven a user is an `agency admin`,\r\n\r\nWhen they try to access admin pages,\r\n\r\nThen they would only be able to access admin pages within their own agency.  When an `admin user` visits the `/adminadmin user management page`, then browser should redirect to their agency admin page at `admin/agencies/:agencyid` with a placeholder page\r\n\r\n\r\n(Looking at the isAdmin policy would provide an example of the updated policy)\r\n\r\n\u003chr /\u003e\r\n\r\n### 3.)

Both systems contain very similar information but with very different temporal aspects: Tock contains historical data, while Float contains projected future data. However, the data elements are very similar.\r\n\r\nSince both applications are used for managing the business of 18F, it is critical that the common data elements between the two are regularly reconciled. For instance, analysis quickly breaks down if a project in Float has a `name` attribute that varies from the project `name` attribute in Tock.\r\n\r\nThis issue seeks to provide a command-line script that pulls data from Tock and Float and returns a list of possibly-duplicate project names.\r\nThe primary user of this application is 18F's internal manager of Tock and Float. The primary use case is running the on-demand via command line that checks for inconsistencies between Tock and Float across the following fields: \r\n\r\n(1) person names; \r\n\r\n(2) project names;\r\n\r\n(3) client names;  and \r\n\r\n(4) project --\u003e client associations.\r\n\r\nBoth applications have straightforward APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Auction rules \r\n\r\nRegistered users on micropurchase.18f.gov may bid to deliver the requirements in this auction.
